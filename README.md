## First version of Arkanoid game.
in this version , besides the bouncing balls we added before ,<br>
we will add **blocks** that are obstacles on the screen, and **Paddle** which is the "player" : a block controlled by the keyboard. When the ball hits either the blocks or the paddle, it will change its direction.
